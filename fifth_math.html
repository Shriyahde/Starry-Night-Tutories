    <h1>Fifth Grade Math</h1>
    <p>Students attend math classes and are expected to learn specific areas during the school semester. At the 
        end of the year, students take a Math EOG to test their mathematics skills of 5th grade. Be sure to study
        with your child so you can have higher grades on this. <br>
        
        Units in Math are:
    </p>
    <ul class="lists-h3">
        <li>Decimals</li>
        <li>Place Values</li>
        <li>Rounding numbers</li>
        <li>Multiplication and Division</li>
        <li>Volume</li>
        <li>Coordinate Planes</li>
        <li>Classifying Figures and Shapes</li>
        <li>Line plots</li>
        <li>Adding and Subtracting Fractions, and Multiplying and Dividing Fractions</li>
        <li>Conversions</li>
        <li>Numerical Expressions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Reviewing mathematics throughout the year with your child is helpful so students can have practice outside of school
            with maths and understand terms.
